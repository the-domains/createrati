# Some Thoughts On Getting "The Right Logo" for Your Business

A long, long time ago, I started a blog.

Then someone told me it wasn't focused enough.

---

Fair enough, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do at the time. I left my corporate career to find (not follow) my passion.

This page started as a travel/fashion blog page, and it evolved now to what my calling really is: design.

These days I worry about making sure my posts relate to design.

And yet there's so much I want to share with everyone that it just gets filtered out.

Should I just share it on my page? Or on my personal timeline?

All these decisions can be tough.

Which is better---posting more cohesive posts or just posting what I love?

Are we just fitting the mould of what the world thinks we should be?

Instead of listening to what it is that calls us. That excites us.

Oscar Wilde once said: "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."

If we're running our own businesses, shouldn't we just be ourselves?

We're multifaceted and that's what makes us unique, what makes our personal brands unique.

Suppressing that which makes us unique, to fit the idea that the world expects of you is probably why so many entrepreneurs are confused about getting their logo right.

This is the foundation of why I'm building my design mentorship program,[The Brand Tour][0].

That we all have everything within us, from collective experiences and ideas, to become the creative director of our own brands.

We need to let go of the pressure of coming up with an "original logo".

Something that I, as a designer, face a lot.

The thing is, we just gotta let go sometimes.

The idea will come when it's ready to show up.

But there's just one thing: you have to show up first.

# Your hair is a mess.

Ever had someone say this to you? Or of you?

And, by any chance, did you find yourself wanting to defend yourself?

Would it really help to tell them that you've just been travelling for over 12 hours?

And that you haven't brought your trusty hair conditioner?

Or had time to blow-dry your hair? 

Which you never had to do anyway because you live in a non-humid climate and it's punishing you for taking it to a humid one?

Or that you just had it cut 12 inches short, with layers, so you can get a "messy" look?

Then you turn to the one person whose opinion matters to you.

"Do you think my hair is a mess?", you ask. 

Because years of preconditioned belief that you're unpretty is hard to shake off.

He answers, "What are you talking about? I don't think your hair looks messy. You always look good to me."

At that point, you realise that there's the one of the two opinions that really matters to you. 

And it ain't theirs.

I happen to like my messy hair.

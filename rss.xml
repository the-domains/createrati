(Two of the top tennis champs in our lifetime!)</p>,<p>I just loved how generous, gracious, and tenacious both legends are.</p>,<p>Most of all, how Federer and Nadal leveraged their own strengths, which they used to conquer the other’s weaknesses.</p>,<p>Nadal used power and spin on his shots, targeting Federer’s weak backhand, and how Federer used wit and persistence to target Nadal’s backhand issues as well.<br>Which made me think a lot about branding and visual identity.</p>,<p>We all have something in us and in our businesses that separate us from others. <br>Nadal had power, Federer had tactics. What's yours?</p>,<p>Can't think of any? No worries!</p>,<h2>3 quick questions to help you refine your branding</h2>,<p>1. What makes you angry and annoyed in your industry? What is it about your industry you’d like to change? (Source: Seth Godin)<br>2. What are your weaknesses? Can you somehow turn them into strengths? (Source: Daymond John)<br>3. How can you tie both in to your brand’s visual identity?<br>As for me, I don’t like how design and creativity is perceived by many as a talent or gift for the select few.</p>,<p>How it sometimes can feel elitist, unattainable, impossible.</p>,<p>My weaknesses? I’m an unknown, self-taught designer with no prestigious awards or degrees from a leading university. I’m not even a veteran yet in any sense of the word. <br>I’m also an introvert so thinking about PR and video gives me the hives.</p>,<p>But I’ve found ways to get around this by keeping things simple, to get creative every day, and to continually strive for excellence.</p>,<h2>Simplicity, creativity and excellence.</h2>,<p>That’s why my brand just consists of black (sometimes near-black navy) and white for simplicity, pale gold and silver for excellence, and bright purple to add a hint of creativity and playfulness. <br>Also, there’s a bit of rebellion against design being commoditised so I added the premium touches. Can’t mistake me from Fiverr now! ;)<br>Your turn! Let me know what yours are, I'd love to know.</p>,<p>Still stuck picking colours? Got great news for you!</p>,<p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll be introducing colours to you in a bit of an unconventional way.</p>,<p>Sure, there’s colour psychology charts out there (just check out Pinterest) that kinda give you an idea, but my problem with them is that they are too general.</p>,<p>For instance, they say blue is for trust, efficiency, intelligence. But there’s so many shades of blue — did you pick the right shade?</p>,<p>What about the right combo?</p>,<p>(Oh, and in case you’re wondering, my favourite reference for stunning colour combinations? <a href="http://bit.ly/therealhue" title="">Check it out: The Real Hue: What You Didn’t Know About Colour.</a>)<br>Excited? I know I am. ;)</p>,<p>Is there a specific colour you want to get to know first?</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/5e971b17a7f5b6cff4bdf9ad5307d3fd/croprotate.png?cropheight=1484&cropwidth=718&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0ca1bc12-4bc6-4d15-baee-2fa2fb895b7f.png&x=9&y=9">]]></description>

I don’t think your hair looks messy.

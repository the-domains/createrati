It's great for quick graphics and inspiration. With Canva for work, you get the convenience of having consistent visuals. But if you prefer to use it for free, check out Design Feed (a tool I've classified under social media due to its main purpose of providing ease for generating social media graphics).</p>]]></description>

We could use the free tickets to just about any destination in the Jetstar network, so we looked for places that was far enough to maximise the ticket value, but not too far that we lose so much time in the air. We only had one weekend to spare after having just come back from a big trip. It is at this point that we decided to go to Queenstown, NZ.</p>,<h2>The Southern Alps</h2>]]></description>

If you have a demanding full-time job, I would advise against this, or at least try and outsource some tasks to a bridesmaid or hire a virtual assistant to at least answer your guests’ questions.</p>]]></description>

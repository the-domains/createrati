            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Singapore Airlines Suite Class Experience</p>,<p>I've always been happy flying economy, because despite the cramped space, I could just cozy up with a book, a movie, perhaps some wine on a full-service flight, and sleep like a baby. I knew that it was a temporary discomfort because after a few hours, I'd be in my destination with all the space I can explore (sometimes, too much space on those times when you do a lot of walking).</p>]]></description>

If you have a demanding full-time job, I would advise against this, or at least try and outsource some tasks to a bridesmaid or hire a virtual assistant to at least answer your guests’ questions.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[How To Set Boundaries]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether in business or personal life, one of the biggest problems that we face is how to say no. In such a noisy world with so many things happening, we have the tendency to not want to miss out, and so the word NO becomes almost hard to pronounce. As young kids, we were taught to be nice, but somehow, someone forgot to tell us to first be nice to ourselves, then be nice to others.</p>,<p>I ran into this problem a while ago with a publication calling me on behalf of the police. They appealed to my wanting to be part of a community. To help out. When I said yes, the next thing I knew, the same publication calls me about another cause. And then another. At some point, for a small business like myself, I realised that there can only be so much causes I can support. I also realise now why even celebrities only choose one philanthropic cause. You only have so much resources (be it time or money) that while it's sooo hard to say no at the time, you will end up feeling much better in the long run. And everyone will be happier, because when you say yes, you later might end up resenting that you said yes, and that ends up worse than when you said no in the first place.</p>]]></description>

So many things are wanting our attention.</p>,<p>And sometimes, we drown out the things seeking our attention with even more noise. (Or when you spray perfume in your hair because you didn't have time to wash it—deep down, you know it still really reeks and you hope no one would get closer.)</p>]]></description>
